# ML-Project

I've added code in 'combine_data.ipynb'
It reads in all the data files and combines them into one (full_data), with an added column called usage.  
if you put your data into a folder called dublinbikes in your ML-PROJECT folder and create a data folder, it should run for you.

usage is just the absolute diff between AVAILABLE_BIKES - it's wrong for each of the first rows of  the stations, so if one of you can fix it?
